Unity_FlappyBird
================

A flappy bird clone I built for a talk I did at the Utah Code Camp 2014 conference

Note: In order to get the GUI elements working you will need to purchase a copy of 2D Toolkit from the Unity Asset Store. It's well worth the money though and every Unity3D developer should have a copy IMO.
